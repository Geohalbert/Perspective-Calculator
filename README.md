  React Native Navigation + Firebase + MobX + Other Goodies
</h1>

This app was built using my former mentor's starter kit (https://github.com/alexwasner/react-native-mobx-firebase-starter)

A React Native app with Wix React Native Navigation V2, MobX, Lottie, Firebase and more...

Architecture includes navigation, registering and login with Firebase, Lottie animations and some default packages I tend to use.

Also includes a default [Firebase Cloud Function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) for saving user info to Firebase when registering.
